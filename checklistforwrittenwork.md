title: Checklist for Students Submitting Written Work
---
<input type="checkbox"> First page has your name, the date, the name of the class, and your email address

<input type="checkbox"> Body text is in 11- or 12-point type, and is double-spaced

<input type="checkbox"> Pages have 1-inch or larger margins on all four sides

<input type="checkbox"> If more than one page in length, each page is numbered

<input type="checkbox"> All sources are properly cited, with page numbers

<input type="checkbox"> You have used one of the two [citation styles required by the Politics Department](http://politics.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/citation.html) unless the assignment specifies something else

<input type="checkbox"> You have read it through once for solidity and completeness of argument

<input type="checkbox"> You have read it through a second time for clarity, flow, word choice, and smoothness

<input type="checkbox"> You have read it through a final time for errors in spelling, grammar, and typography

<input type="checkbox"> You have run it through your word processor's spell-checker, as a last line of defense

<input type="checkbox"> Typically I ask that you submit the paper as a Word document rather than as a printed-out hard copy. But if it's the latter, and if the paper is more than one page in length, it should be cleanly stapled (not paper-clipped).
