title: Notes on Software that I Use
---
Below are some thoughts on software applications that I have found useful. I have no relationship with the vendors other than that of customer and user. I've skipped a few omnipresent programs that I use but have nothing in particular to say about, such as web browsers. Comments and suggestions welcome.

<B>Operating system</B>: MacOS (laptop and office desktop); Android (on my phone).

<B>Bibliographic database</B>: I switched to [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) from EndNote in February 2016. I use Zotero Standalone as well as the Firefox add-on. As Zotero matured, its advantages (excellent data acquisition, superior keyword management, free and open source, excellent web server sync and sharing, better data import/export, etc.) overwhelmed the small number of features where EndNote could still be said to have an edge.

<B>File synchronization</B>: For a long time I tried to keep all my files based on just a single system, aside from backups. But it makes much more sense to keep mirrored copies of critical folder trees on each computer in use, as well as on a server drive. Careful synchronization then becomes a must. I use [Syncovery](http://www.syncovery.com/). I also use the amazing Dropbox, but I don't try to keep all my working files on it.

<B>Password management</B>: [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) is free, open-source, thoughtfully done &mdash; in short, lovable.

<B>Text editor</B>: [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) won me over. I like the clean GUI, customizability, and the excellent selection of third-party plug-ins.

<B>Statistics</B>: [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) 14, and occasionally R.

<B>Word processor</B>: I was a WordPerfect dead-ender, cherishing the memories of versions 4.2 and 5.1, which got me through college. The realities of academic publishing and collaboration, along with the need to work with Chinese-language material, made me reluctantly switch to Word. As I learned more about it, I came to embrace its paragraph-based, object-oriented ways. For those not already familiar with Word's finer points and the efficient but widely neglected styles feature, definitely see the late Shauna Kelly(http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/)'s site, and also the [MVP](http://word.mvps.org/) site.
